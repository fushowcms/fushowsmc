### 2.3.Tag mapping

It's idealized of using IMapper for all naming. But if table or column is not in rule, we need new method to archive.

* If struct or pointer of struct has `TableName() string` method, the return value will be the struct's table name.

* `engine.Table()` can change the database table name for struct. The struct tag `xorm:"'table_name'"` can set column name for struct field. Use a pair of single quotes to prevent confusion for column's definition in struct tag. If not in confusion, ignore single quotes.
